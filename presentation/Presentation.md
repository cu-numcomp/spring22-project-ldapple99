## What is Coral?
Created by Benjamin Miquel at the Université Paris-Saclay, CEA, CNRS, Service de Physique de l’Etat Condensé (University of Paris-Saclay, CEA, CNRS, Service of Condensed Matter Physics), Coral is a speedy and effiecent time-stepper for solving a wide range of partial differential equations, for example the Navier-Stokes equations below which make up a large portion of fluid dynamics.

## What is Coral trying to solve?
  * Rootfinding? Interpolation? Regression?
  * Is it general-purpose software or domain-specific? What makes it unique? 
Coral is trying to ....

## Who are the stakeholders of Coral?
  * Who develops the software, who uses it, who pays for it?
  * What are they looking for?
  * How do they communicate and collaborate?
  * Who uses the software?
  * Who is impacted (positively or negatively) by use of the software?
 Coral was written by...

## What are the Metrics and Features of Coral?
  * How do concepts like accuracy, conditioning, stability, and cost appear?
  * If the software is fast, how is "fast" defined?
  * If the software is accurate, what does accuracy mean? Could you make a plot, say accuracy vs cost? How would you label the axes to make it relevant to    a stakeholder?
  * Would different stakeholders want different axes (because they care about different things)?
  * Are there modeling decisions made in the interest of good conditioning? Are there algorithmic choices made for stability?
Some of the tests that were done for Coral include...
