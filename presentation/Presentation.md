## What are the Metrics and Features of Coral?
  * How do concepts like accuracy, conditioning, stability, and cost appear?
  * If the software is fast, how is "fast" defined?
  * If the software is accurate, what does accuracy mean? Could you make a plot, say accuracy vs cost? How would you label the axes to make it relevant to    a stakeholder?
  * Would different stakeholders want different axes (because they care about different things)?
  * Are there modeling decisions made in the interest of good conditioning? Are there algorithmic choices made for stability?
Some of the tests that were done for Coral include...
